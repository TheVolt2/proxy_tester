**Project Description: GAN Training Dynamics Analysis**

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate handwritten digit images (specifically, the digit '9' from the MNIST dataset) while analyzing the training dynamics between the generator and discriminator. The key components include:

1. **Network Architecture**:
   - A generator that transforms 2D latent space vectors into 28x28 grayscale images using transposed convolutional layers.
   - A discriminator with convolutional layers that classifies images as real or generated.

2. **Training Process**:
   - Implements adversarial training with binary cross-entropy loss
   - Tracks and visualizes both generator and discriminator losses throughout training
   - Uses Adam optimizers with learning rate 1e-4 for both networks

3. **Key Features**:
   - Detailed loss tracking for both networks during training
   - Visualization of loss dynamics to monitor the adversarial balance
   - Example generation from different points in latent space

4. **Analysis Capabilities**:
   - Identifies whether the generator or discriminator is dominating
   - Detects training instability or mode collapse
   - Evaluates convergence through loss patterns

The project demonstrates fundamental GAN behavior while providing tools to diagnose common training challenges. The visualization of loss dynamics offers insights into the adversarial equilibrium critical for successful GAN training.
